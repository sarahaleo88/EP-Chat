Show me the current project management status by running the status script and displaying:

1. **Active PRDs** and their current status
2. **Current epics** and implementation progress  
3. **Open issues** and task assignments
4. **Recent activity** and updates
5. **Next recommended actions**

Run: `bash .claude/scripts/pm/status.sh`
