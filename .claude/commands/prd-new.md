Create a comprehensive Product Requirements Document (PRD) for: **$ARGUMENTS**

Please help me:

1. Ask clarifying questions about the feature "$ARGUMENTS"
2. Create a structured PRD with all necessary sections:
   - Executive Summary
   - Problem Statement  
   - User Stories & Personas
   - Functional/Non-functional Requirements
   - Success Criteria
   - Constraints & Dependencies

3. Save to `.claude/prds/$ARGUMENTS.md` with proper frontmatter

4. Suggest next steps for implementation planning

Let's begin the discovery process.
