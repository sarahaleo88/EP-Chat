Create a comprehensive Product Requirements Document (PRD) for the feature: $ARGUMENTS

Please follow this structured approach:

1. **Discovery & Context**: Ask clarifying questions about the feature
2. **Problem Statement**: Define what problem we're solving
3. **User Stories**: Identify target users and use cases
4. **Requirements**: List functional and non-functional requirements
5. **Success Criteria**: Define measurable outcomes
6. **Constraints**: Note technical and timeline limitations

Save the completed PRD to `.claude/prds/$ARGUMENTS.md` with proper frontmatter including name, description, status, and creation date.
