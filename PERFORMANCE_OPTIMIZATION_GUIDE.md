- **Smooth Animations**: Optimized transitions and loading states
- **Graceful Error Recovery**: Automatic retry with user notification

## 🔍 Troubleshooting Performance Issues

### **If Response Times Are Slow**
1. Check internet connection stability
2. Verify API key is valid and has quota
3. Monitor cache hit rate (should be >60%)
4. Use Performance Monitor to identify bottlenecks

### **If Cache Hit Rate Is Low**
1. Check if similar queries are being made
2. Verify cache size isn't full (max 75 entries)
3. Consider clearing cache and retesting
4. Monitor for cache key generation issues

### **If Streaming Isn't Working**
1. Verify API key has streaming permissions
2. Check browser console for JavaScript errors
3. Test with Performance Monitor's streaming tests
4. Ensure network supports streaming connections

## 🚀 Advanced Performance Tips

### **Optimal Usage Patterns**
- **Reuse Similar Queries**: Take advantage of semantic caching
- **Moderate Request Frequency**: Allow debounce to optimize input
- **Monitor Performance**: Regular checks using built-in tools
- **Clear Cache Periodically**: Fresh start for testing new optimizations

### **Performance Monitoring Best Practices**
- **Weekly Performance Reviews**: Check metrics trends
- **Cache Optimization**: Adjust based on usage patterns  
- **Error Rate Monitoring**: Maintain <5% error rate
- **Response Time Tracking**: Watch for performance regression

## 📊 Performance Grading System

The automated testing provides performance grades:

- **A+ (90-100 points)**: Excellent performance, all targets exceeded
- **A (80-89 points)**: Very good performance, most targets met
- **B (70-79 points)**: Good performance, some optimization opportunities
- **C (60-69 points)**: Fair performance, needs attention
- **D (<60 points)**: Poor performance, requires immediate optimization

## 🎯 Maintaining Peak Performance
