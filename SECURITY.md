## Security Best Practices

### For Users

1. **API Keys**: Never commit API keys to version control
2. **Environment Variables**: Use `.env.local` for sensitive configuration
3. **Updates**: Keep dependencies updated regularly
4. **HTTPS**: Always use HTTPS in production deployments

### For Developers

1. **Input Validation**: Validate all user inputs
2. **Sanitization**: Sanitize data before processing
3. **Authentication**: Implement proper authentication mechanisms
4. **Logging**: Log security events appropriately (without sensitive data)

## Known Security Considerations

### API Key Management

- API keys are stored in browser localStorage
- Keys are not transmitted to our servers
- Consider using environment variables for server-side deployments

### Data Privacy

- Chat conversations are not stored permanently
- API requests go directly to DeepSeek servers
- No user data is collected or stored by EP Chat

### Dependencies

- Regular security audits of npm dependencies
- Automated vulnerability scanning in CI/CD
- Prompt updates for critical security patches
