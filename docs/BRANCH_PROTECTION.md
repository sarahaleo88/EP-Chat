# üõ°Ô∏è Branch Protection Policy

This document outlines EP Chat's branch protection strategy and required settings to maintain code quality, security, and project integrity.

## üéØ Policy Overview

Branch protection is a critical security control that ensures all changes to the main codebase undergo proper review, testing, and validation before integration.

## üîí Protected Branches

### Main Branch (`main`)
**Protection Level**: Maximum Security
**Purpose**: Production-ready code
**Required Settings**:

#### Pull Request Requirements
- ‚úÖ **Require pull requests before merging**
- ‚úÖ **Require at least 1 approval from code owners**
- ‚úÖ **Dismiss stale reviews when new commits are pushed**
- ‚úÖ **Require review from code owners**
- ‚úÖ **Restrict reviews to users with write permissions**

#### Status Check Requirements
- ‚úÖ **Require status checks to pass before merging**
- ‚úÖ **Require branches to be up to date before merging**
- **Required Checks**:
  - `test (18.x)` - Node.js 18 test suite
  - `test (20.x)` - Node.js 20 test suite
  - `build` - Production build validation
  - `security` - Security audit check
  - `lint` - Code quality check
  - `type-check` - TypeScript validation

#### Push Restrictions
- ‚úÖ **Restrict pushes that create files over 100MB**
- ‚úÖ **Prevent force pushes**

  - Emergency security patches only
  - Must be documented and reviewed post-incident

### Development Branch (`develop`)
**Protection Level**: Standard
**Purpose**: Integration branch for features
**Required Settings**:

  - `type-check` - TypeScript validation

#### Push Restrictions
- ‚úÖ **Prevent force pushes**
- ‚úÖ **Prevent branch deletion**
- ‚ùå Restrict pushes (maintainers can push directly for minor fixes)

### Release Branches (`release/*`)
**Protection Level**: High
**Purpose**: Release preparation and stabilization
**Required Settings**:

#### Pull Request Requirements
- ‚úÖ **Require pull requests before merging**
- ‚úÖ **Require at least 1 approval from maintainers**
- ‚úÖ **Require review from release manager**

#### Status Check Requirements
- ‚úÖ **Require status checks to pass before merging**
- ‚úÖ **Require branches to be up to date before merging**
- **Required Checks**:
  - `test (18.x)` - Node.js 18 compatibility
  - `test (20.x)` - Node.js 20 primary version
  - `build` - Production build validation
  - `security` - Security audit
  - `integration-test` - End-to-end tests

## üë• Access Control

### Code Owners
Code owners are automatically requested for review on protected branches.

#### Global Code Owners (`CODEOWNERS`)
```
# Global rules
* @project-lead @security-lead

# Critical files require security review
/SECURITY.md @security-lead
/docs/SECURITY_*.md @security-lead
/.github/workflows/ @project-lead @security-lead

# Dependencies require security review
/package.json @security-lead
/package-lock.json @security-lead

# Configuration files
/.github/ @project-lead
/next.config.js @project-lead
/tsconfig.json @project-lead

# API routes require careful review
/app/api/ @project-lead @security-lead

# Security-sensitive components
/lib/deepseek*.ts @security-lead
/lib/security/ @security-lead
```

### Reviewer Requirements

#### Mandatory Reviewers
- **Security Changes**: Security lead required
- **API Changes**: Project lead required
- **Infrastructure**: Both leads required
- **Dependencies**: Security lead required

#### Review Guidelines
- **Security Focus**: All reviewers must consider security implications
- **Performance Impact**: Review bundle size and performance impact
- **Breaking Changes**: Explicit approval for breaking changes
- **Documentation**: Ensure documentation is updated

## üö® Emergency Procedures

### Hotfix Process
For critical security vulnerabilities or production issues:

1. **Assessment**: Confirm emergency status
2. **Approval**: Security lead + project lead approval
3. **Direct Push**: Authorized emergency push to main
4. **Immediate Review**: Create post-incident PR for review
5. **Documentation**: Document emergency bypass reason
6. **Process Review**: Review and improve emergency procedures

### Emergency Bypass Criteria
- **Critical Security Vulnerability**: CVSS 9.0+ actively exploited
- **Production Down**: Complete service unavailability
- **Data Loss Risk**: Imminent risk of data corruption/loss
- **Legal/Compliance**: Immediate compliance requirement

### Post-Emergency Requirements
- **Incident Report**: Within 24 hours
- **Review PR**: Full code review of emergency changes
- **Process Improvement**: Update procedures based on learnings
- **Communication**: Notify stakeholders of emergency changes

## üìä Compliance Monitoring

### Automated Checks
- **Branch Protection Status**: Daily verification of protection settings
- **Code Owner Coverage**: Ensure all critical paths have code owners
- **Review Compliance**: Monitor review requirements compliance
- **Bypass Monitoring**: Track and audit all protection bypasses

### Metrics & Reporting

#### Weekly Metrics
- **Protection Compliance**: % of merges following protection rules
- **Review Coverage**: % of changes with required reviews
- **Bypass Incidents**: Number and reason for protection bypasses
- **Time to Review**: Average time from PR creation to approval

#### Monthly Reports
- **Security Review Coverage**: % of security-sensitive changes reviewed
- **Emergency Bypasses**: Detailed report of emergency procedures used
- **Process Violations**: Any violations of branch protection policy
- **Improvement Recommendations**: Suggested policy updates
