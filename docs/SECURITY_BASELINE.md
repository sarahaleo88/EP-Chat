# üîí OpenSSF Security Baseline Compliance

EP Chat is designed to meet and exceed the [OpenSSF Security Baseline](https://openssf.org/baseline/) requirements for open-source projects. This document outlines our security posture and compliance status.

## üéØ Compliance Status: ‚úÖ FULLY COMPLIANT

| Requirement | Status | Implementation |
|-------------|--------|----------------|
| Multi-Factor Authentication | ‚úÖ Required | GitHub organization requires 2FA for all maintainers |
| Restricted Permissions | ‚úÖ Implemented | Least-privilege access controls, manual permission assignment |
| Branch Protection | ‚úÖ Active | Main branch protected, requires PR + reviews + status checks |
| Signed Releases | ‚úÖ Automated | Sigstore signing + cryptographic checksums |
| SBOM Generation | ‚úÖ Automated | CycloneDX SBOM included in all releases |
| Dependency Management | ‚úÖ Documented | Automated updates + security scanning |
| Vulnerability Reporting | ‚úÖ Process | Coordinated disclosure via GitHub Security Advisories |
| Automated Testing | ‚úÖ Required | CI/CD blocks merges without passing tests |
| Documentation | ‚úÖ Complete | Architecture, threat model, security policies |

## üîê Security Requirements

### Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)
- **Requirement**: All maintainers and contributors with write access must enable 2FA
- **Implementation**: GitHub organization settings enforce 2FA requirement
- **Verification**: Regular audits of organization members

### Access Control & Permissions
- **Principle**: Least privilege access
- **Implementation**:
  - Manual permission assignment (no automatic access)
  - Role-based access control (RBAC)
  - Regular access reviews and cleanup
  - Separation of duties for sensitive operations

### Branch Protection Rules
Main branch protection includes:
- ‚úÖ Require pull requests before merging
- ‚úÖ Require at least 1 approval from code owners
- ‚úÖ Require status checks to pass before merging
- ‚úÖ Require branches to be up to date before merging
- ‚úÖ Restrict pushes to specific people/teams
- ‚úÖ Prevent force pushes
- ‚úÖ Prevent branch deletion

### CI/CD Security
- **Least Privilege**: Default `permissions: contents: read`
- **Input Validation**: All CI/CD inputs are sanitized
- **Secret Management**: No secrets in code, all managed via GitHub Secrets
- **Immutable Builds**: Reproducible builds with lockfile integrity
- **Dependency Scanning**: Automated vulnerability scanning

## üõ°Ô∏è Security Controls

### Code Security
- **Static Analysis**: ESLint security rules + TypeScript strict mode
- **Dependency Scanning**: npm audit + Dependabot security updates
- **Secret Scanning**: GitHub secret scanning enabled
- **Code Review**: Required for all changes to main branch

### Release Security
- **Signed Releases**: All releases signed with Sigstore
- **Checksums**: SHA256 checksums for all release assets
- **SBOM**: Software Bill of Materials included
- **Provenance**: Build provenance via GitHub Actions

### Infrastructure Security
- **Container Security**: Docker image scanning + minimal base images
- **Network Security**: HTTPS-only communications
- **Environment Isolation**: Separate dev/staging/production environments
- **Monitoring**: Security event logging and monitoring

## üìã Security Procedures

### Vulnerability Response
1. **Intake**: Via GitHub Security Advisories (private)
2. **Triage**: Within 48 hours, severity assessment
3. **Response**: Fix timeline based on severity (critical: 7 days)
4. **Disclosure**: Coordinated disclosure after fix deployment
5. **Post-mortem**: Security improvement recommendations

### Security Updates
- **Critical**: Emergency patch within 24-48 hours
- **High**: Patch within 7 days
- **Medium**: Patch within 30 days
- **Low**: Next planned release

### Incident Response
1. **Detection**: Automated monitoring + manual reporting
2. **Assessment**: Impact and severity evaluation
3. **Containment**: Immediate threat mitigation
4. **Investigation**: Root cause analysis
5. **Recovery**: Service restoration
6. **Lessons Learned**: Process improvements

## üîç Compliance Verification

### Regular Audits
- **Monthly**: Access permissions review
- **Quarterly**: Security baseline compliance check
- **Annually**: Third-party security assessment

### Monitoring & Metrics
- **Failed login attempts**: Tracked and alerted
- **Permission changes**: Logged and reviewed
- **Dependency vulnerabilities**: Automatically scanned
- **Build integrity**: Verified via checksums

### Documentation Maintenance
- **Security policies**: Reviewed quarterly
- **Threat model**: Updated with architecture changes
- **Incident playbooks**: Tested and refined

## üö® Emergency Contacts

For security incidents:
1. **GitHub Security Advisories**: Private vulnerability reporting
2. **Project Maintainers**: Via GitHub @mentions for urgent issues
3. **Community**: Public disclosure after remediation
