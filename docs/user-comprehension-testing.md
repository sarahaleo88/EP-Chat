## Testing Methodology

### 1. A/B Testing Design

#### Control Group (Basic Renderer)
- Uses existing SecureMessageRenderer
- Standard text formatting
- No progressive disclosure
- Linear content presentation

#### Test Group (Enhanced Renderer)
- Uses SecureEnhancedMessageRenderer
- Progressive disclosure templates
- Hierarchical information structure
- Enhanced visual organization

#### Randomization
```typescript
// Balanced assignment to test groups
const assignTestGroup = (userId: string): 'enhanced' | 'basic' => {
  const hash = simpleHash(userId);
  return hash % 2 === 0 ? 'enhanced' : 'basic';
};
```

### 2. Test Execution Process

#### Phase 1: Introduction
- Explain test purpose and process
- Collect participant demographics
- Set expectations for duration and tasks

#### Phase 2: Content Review
- Present test content using assigned renderer
- Allow unlimited time for initial review
- Track time spent reviewing content

#### Phase 3: Comprehension Questions
- Present questions in randomized order
- Measure response time and accuracy
- Collect confidence ratings for each answer

#### Phase 4: Task Completion
- Present tasks in order of increasing complexity
- Track completion time and accuracy
- Record interaction patterns and errors

#### Phase 5: Feedback Collection
- Gather subjective feedback on experience
- Collect preference ratings
- Allow open-ended comments

### 3. Data Collection and Analysis

#### Real-Time Metrics
```typescript
// Track user interactions during test
const trackInteraction = (action: string, element: string, timestamp: number) => {
  analytics.track('test_interaction', {
    action,
    element,
    timestamp,
    testId: currentTest.id,
    userId: currentUser.id,
    renderingMode: currentMode
  });
};
```

#### Statistical Analysis
```typescript
// Calculate improvement metrics
const calculateImprovement = (baseline: number, enhanced: number): number => {
  return ((enhanced - baseline) / baseline) * 100;
};

// Significance testing
const performTTest = (controlGroup: number[], testGroup: number[]): {
  pValue: number;
  significant: boolean;
  confidenceInterval: [number, number];
} => {
  // Statistical analysis implementation
};
```

## Test Implementation

### 1. Automated Test Runner

#### Component Architecture
```typescript
// Main test runner component
<ComprehensionTestRunner
  testId="code-comprehension-test"
  userId={user.id}
  renderingMode={assignedMode}
  onComplete={handleTestComplete}
/>
```

#### Phase Management
